## Business Activities:

<pre>What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?</pre>

"Only about 47% of Canadians create a budget and follow it" according to Practical Money Skills
 
*Practical Money Skills Canada. Financial LiteracyFor Everyone.* 
(https://www.practicalmoneyskills.ca/personalfinance/savingspending/budgeting/)

A great deal of Canadian individuals have no budget or money management plan in place to reach their personal goals. Nor do they have a direct plan to live comfortably in their retirement years.
  Many Canadians live in debt with no direction or site in mind to  live debt free, they also lack the education or knowledge to freely budget themselves in a positive direction of money management.
  This has become an increasingly growing concern among millennials and generation x individuals.

" Canadians are house rich but heavily in debt.Canadians confidence in their personal finances has and ability to pay debt has a record low ........the value of combined mortgage home equity line of credit loans stood at $737-billion up a third since the start of the pandemic"

(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-warning-canadians-are-house-rich-but-heavily-in-debt/)

Individuals are using the equity in their homes and real estate to secure bigger line of credits and are ultimately spending more than their income can sustain.
Canadians need some sort of assistance or tech to guide them into system of money management

<pre>Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?</pre>

### Recommendations

<pre>If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)</pre>

While doing intensive research on Mogo's Pros and Cons I noticed that there was one reacuring issue with Mogo and their platform.
Their lack of customer support is quite evident. According to the Better Business Bureau they have a poor rating of 1.16 out 5.

(https://www.bbb.org/ca/bc/vancouver/profile/financial-services/mogo-0037-1233608)

(https://www.bbb.org/ca/bc/vancouver/profile/financial-services/mogo-0037-1233608/customer-reviews)

Mogo's reviews have directly impacted their public presence and creditability. After a self expiramnt an email was sent with no reply to date. Their respnse time is aggonizing. This is a finacial Domain where people's money and credit health are in question it causes an extreme trust issue. Mogo definetly has a void in tech worthy applications for customer service.

Mogo's competitiors are far more advanced in the area of customer service and response times

A suggestion would be to incorporate a platform in their App to help with customer issues and to have a quick resolve time so clients are at ease with their fnancial stability. By offering this It would validate their business model and customer loyalty.

Some technologies offerd in this area are:
1) SPRINKLR
(https://www.sprinklr.com/b/)

2) FRONT
(https://front.com/)

3)GORGIAS
(https://www.gorgias.com/)

4) ADA
(https://www.ada.cx/)

5) HATCH
(https://www.usehatchapp.com/)

6)ELEVIO
(https://elev.io/)

Offering these platforms within the Mogo app would relieve the tension between clients and Mogo. it wouls also relieve stress within the Mogo infrastructure and employees.

Also apprent is Mogo's limited capability to invest in crypto currency. Mogo only offers the ability to trade Bitcoin. With the growing trend in Crypto purchases it would be wise to expand their options in purchasung other coins and forms of curency. A simple and cost affective solution would maybe partner up with some leading credible Crypto platforms as the did with Visa in their Mogo Spend feature. This would istantly open a wide market of crypto to their clients. This would also drive a whole new target market to the Mogo app.
