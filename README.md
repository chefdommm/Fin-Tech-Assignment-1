Meaning a great deal of Canadian individuals have no budget or money management plan in place to reach their personal goals or have a direct plan to live comfortably in their retirement years.
  Many Canadians live in debt with no plan or site in mind to  live debt free, they also lack the education or knowledge to freely budget themselves in a positive direction of money management.
  This has become an increasingly growing concern among millennials and generation x individuals.
